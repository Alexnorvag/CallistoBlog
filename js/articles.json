      "content": "Whales and dolphins — both members of the cetacean family — are among the brainiest beings. Scientists have now identified differences among them that are tied to relative brain size. And now, scientists have identified key differences among cetaceans linked to brain size. A study of 90 cetacean species found that those with larger brains exhibit greater complexity in social structures and behaviors, with species like the killer whale and whale leading the way.",

      "content": "Recently physicists have been poking holes again in Stephen Hawking’s black hole theory – including Hawking himself. For decades physicists across the globe have been trying to figure out the mysteries of black holes – those fascinating monstrous entities that have such intense gravitational pull that nothing – not even light – can escape from them. Now Professor Chris Adami, Michigan State University, has jumped into the fray.",
